*** Features transform for classification
Feature transforms have been used to model data in an attempt to enhance the tradeoff between generalisation and discrimination, as described in Section [[Introduction]].

Two of the most common feature transform techniques include principal component analysis (PCA) \cite{Pearson1901On} and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) \cite{Duda1973Pa}. This section provides a brief description of their rationale.

Let $\{\Vector{x}_m \in \real^N\}$ be a set of vectors containing features extracted from $M$ training signals.
